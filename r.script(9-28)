#Trouble shooting 'dsb' data#

dat=read.csv("Rdat_BN.csv")
burn=read.csv("burn.vectors.csv")

unique(dat$PointName)
p.name<-levels(dat$PointName)
p.names<-p.name
p.vars<-names(burn)

##these should both have 79 unique point names.  dat has data for many points not run in 2015
##the code below finds point names that differ from the 2015 point names (names in burn)
extra.points<-vector(mode="numeric",length=200)	#make empty vector
for(i in 1:length(p.vars)){for(k in 1:length(p.names)){if(p.vars[i]==p.names[k]){p.names[k]<-"NA"}}}	#get point names that do NOT overlap p.vars (the 79 point names on the maps, run in 2015)
p.names					####point names that do NOT overlaps w/ 2015 point names or burn vectors####
p.names<-p.names[p.names!="NA"]	#remove "NA"'s
write.csv(p.names, "p.names.csv")	#write a csv w/ this data
length(p.name)-length(p.names)	#this equals 79 as expected

dat.r<-dat	#copy of dat

point.v<-vector(mode="character", length=length(dat.r$PointName))	#make a blank vector of length dat.r$PointName, mode="character" important, modes must match!!!!
point.v<-dat.r$PointName[1:length(dat.r$PointName)]	#put data from data frame dat.r into vector for PointName
head(point.v)
point.vv<-point.v	#a copy of point.v that will be used when replacing values in the loop

#make a loop to replace non-2015 point names w/ NAs in the vector 'point.vv'
for(i in 1:length(point.v)){for(k in 1:length(p.names)){if(p.names[k]==point.v[i]){point.vv[i]<-"NA"}}}
dat.r$PointName<-as.character(dat.r$PointName)				#make point name a character
dat.r$PointName<-point.vv							#replace value in dat.r$PointName w/ values from vector point.vv generated in loop (above)
unique(dat.r$PointName)								#look at unique values. notice, there is an "NA" in there which is what replaced point names that do not coorespond w/ a burn vector (i.e. not run in 2015, not on SHG maps BN made)
length(unique(dat.r$PointName))						#length is 80, 79 + the "NA"
length(which(dat.r$PointName=="NA"))					#how many "NA"'s did I generate?
length(dat.r$PointName)								#how many total observations
length(dat.r$PointName)-length(which(dat.r$PointName=="NA"))	#difference=num. of non-"NA"'s left

#turn "NA"'s into real NAs...
length(dat.r$PointName[!is.na(dat.r$PointName)])	#the "NA"'s are NOT being considered as NAs by R
dat.r$PointName[dat.r$PointName=="NA"]=NA			#make them real NAs
length(dat.r$PointName[!is.na(dat.r$PointName)])	#it worked!

#remove rows w/ NA's
dat.omit<-na.omit(dat.r)	#make an new data frame w/ NAs excluded
length(dat.omit$PointName)	#check the length, it checks out.

###okay, but i really need to find out what is going on w/ the names and why names from burn vectors, maps and 2015 survey do not coorespond 100% w/ names from previous years.
###i'm not just going to delete half of our obs. i bet those 130 points w/ diff. names are 'misnamed' but actually coorespond to one of the 1:79 point names
